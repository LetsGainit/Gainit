- Operational intelligence

## Common Logging Patterns

### **Structured Logging Format**
```csharp
r_logger.LogInformation("Operation completed: UserId={UserId}, Duration={Duration}ms, Result={Result}", 
    userId, duration, result);
```

### **Correlation ID Pattern**
```csharp
var correlationId = HttpContext.TraceIdentifier;
r_logger.LogInformation("Operation started: CorrelationId={CorrelationId}, UserId={UserId}", 
    correlationId, userId);
```

### **Performance Measurement Pattern**
```csharp
var startTime = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;
// ... operation ...
var duration = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.Subtract(startTime).TotalMilliseconds;
r_logger.LogInformation("Operation completed: Duration={Duration}ms", duration);
```

### **Error Context Pattern**
```csharp
try
{
    // ... operation ...
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    r_logger.LogError(ex, "Operation failed: UserId={UserId}, Context={Context}", 
        userId, additionalContext);
    throw;
}
```

## Azure Application Insights Integration

### **Telemetry Types**
- **Requests**: HTTP request/response tracking
- **Dependencies**: Database calls, external API calls
- **Exceptions**: Error tracking with full context
- **Traces**: Custom logging with structured data
- **Metrics**: Performance and business metrics

### **Custom Dimensions**
- `UserId`: User identifier for user-specific operations
- `CorrelationId`: Request tracing across components
- `Duration`: Operation timing for performance analysis
- `RemoteIP`: Client IP for security monitoring
- `UserAgent`: Client identification for analytics

### **Query Examples**
```kusto
// User activity monitoring
traces
| where customDimensions.UserId != ""
| summarize count() by customDimensions.UserId, bin(timestamp, 1h)

// Performance analysis
traces
| where message contains "Duration"
| summarize avg(customDimensions.Duration), count() by bin(timestamp, 1h)

// Error rate monitoring
exceptions
| summarize count() by bin(timestamp, 1h)
```

## Log Level Guidelines

### **Information Level**
- Business operations start/completion
- User actions and system events
- Performance metrics and statistics
- Security events and validations

### **Warning Level**
- Validation issues and data problems
- Performance degradation warnings
- Configuration issues and fallbacks
- Business rule violations

### **Error Level**
- Exceptions and system failures
- Authentication and authorization failures
- Database connection issues
- External service failures

### **Debug Level**
- Detailed technical information
- Step-by-step operation details
- Performance timing breakdowns
- Development troubleshooting data

## Performance Considerations

### **Production Optimization**
- Debug logs disabled by default
- Structured logging for efficient querying
- Correlation IDs for minimal overhead
- Performance metrics for bottleneck identification

### **Development Benefits**
- Full debug information available
- Detailed troubleshooting capabilities
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Complete audit trail for testing

## Security and Privacy

### **Data Protection**
- No sensitive data in logs (passwords, tokens)
- PII data minimized and controlled
- Audit trail for security investigations
- Compliance with data protection regulations

### **Security Monitoring**
- Authentication attempt logging
- Failed authorization attempts
- Suspicious activity detection
- IP address and user agent tracking

## Monitoring and Alerting

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
- Request success/failure rates
- Response time percentiles
- Error rates by component
- User activity patterns
- System resource utilization

### **Alerting Recommendations**
- Error rate thresholds (>5% for 5 minutes)
- Performance degradation (>2x normal response time)
- Authentication failure spikes
- Database connection issues
- Health check failures
